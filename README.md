Write Arabic and RTL text in Figma with ease.  Just select a text layer, open the plugin and start writing.

It will also save the original text in case you wanted to update it.

<br />

### FEATURES
- Reshapes Arabic glyphs properly.
- Handles mixed English & Arabic text.
- Provides options/workarounds to fix Figma's limitations with Arabic fonts.
- Supports multiline text.
- Handles numbers in text.

<br />

### LIMITATIONS
- Figma partially reshapes Arabic which causes unexpected results.
- Line wrapping is not supported because it's not possible yet to hook into Figma's wrapping algorithm.
